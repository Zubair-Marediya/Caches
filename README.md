This is the starter skeleton code for the Caches Project I helped create with Nick Riasanovsky for CS 61C students
when I was a Head TA. Unfortunately, the solutions and autograder cannot be released, but feel
free to check out the project spec [here](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/su17/projs/04/).
